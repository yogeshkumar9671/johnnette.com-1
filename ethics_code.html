                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It is the Company's policy that its directors, officers, employees, and Business Partners are held to the highest standards of honest and ethical conduct when conducting the affairs of the Company. In further, it is the personal responsibility of each
                        director, officer, employee and Business Partners of the Company to adhere to the standards and restrictions, whether imposed by law or by this Code, applicable to his or her assigned duties and responsibilities and to conduct
                        himself or herself accordingly. Such standards and restrictions require each director, officer, and employee to avoid any activities which would involve the Company in any practice which is not in compliance with applicable laws
                        or this Code. Any director, officer, employee or Business Partners who does not adhere to such standards and restrictions is acting outside the scope of his or her employment or agency.

                    <p>
                        In particular, this Code summarizes Company's policies and guidelines that ensure and/or promote:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of conflicts of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships.</li>
                        <li>Compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations.</li>
                        <li>Prompt internal reporting of violations of this Code</li>
                        <li>Accountability for adherence to this Code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We believe that conducting Company's business honestly, ethically and with integrity are crucial to Company's continued success and growth and are essential attributes of the Company's reputation. We strongly believe that a reputation
                        for honesty is a priceless asset.</p>

                    <ol type="A">
                        <li style="padding-top: 0;"><strong>General :</strong> The Code's basic standards, together with other Company's procedures, are designated to facilitate honest and ethical conduct. However, these provisions shall not cover all the applicable situations.
                            In event of conflict between the law and Company's ethics policy, you must comply with the law. Still, in event of a conflict with a particular local custom or practice, this Code takes precedence. While local customs and traditions
                            vary from place to place, honesty and integrity are not subject to criticism in any culture.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Compliance with Law :</strong> It is the Company's policy to observe and comply with all laws, rules and regulations of governmental agencies and authorities applicable to the Company or the conduct of Company's business
                            wherever located. Company's directors, officers, employees and Business Partners are not expected to know the details of all applicable laws, rules and regulations. However, they are expected to be familiar with company's published
                            policies and procedures and to seek advice from the Company's legal consultants if they have any questions about whether a legal requirement applies to a particular situation or what conduct may be required to comply with any
                            law, rule or regulation.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Export Controls :</strong> Our Company engages in international trade, export, import, marketing, sales and business entrepreneurship in world markets. As a global Company that manages its business on the international
                            playing field, we strictly comply with the local and international legal regulations for world trade that are incumbent on our activities, including, but not limited to, the export controls laws and regulations. We are obligated
                            to comply with Indian companies act and all regulations promulgated under it and with India, export controls laws and regulations including the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). Strict compliance with all applicable
                            international trade laws and regulations is a critical component for the Company's success in world markets. Therefore, our directors, officers, employees and Business Partners are obligated to comply with the laws related
                            to the Company or business management in India or, wherever the Company conducts its business. If you are uncertain about any performance related to issues of export, import, etc., you should consult with the Company's legal
                            consultant.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Honest and Ethic Conduct :</strong> Beyond legal compliance, all company's directors, officers, employees and Business Partners are expected to observe high standards of business and personal ethics in the execution of
                            their assigned duties and responsibilities. This requires the practice of honesty, integrity and fair dealing in every aspect of dealing with other Company's employees, the business community, shareholders, customers, suppliers
                            and governmental and regulatory authorities. The Company's directors, officers, employees and Business Partners should not take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information,
                            misrepresentation, or any other unfair dealing or practice.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Accounting Controls :</strong> Procedures & Records. Applicable laws, regulations, and Company's policy require the Company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect its transactions and the dispositions
                            of its assets.
